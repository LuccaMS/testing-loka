## Methodology

I started this test by doing some analysis and trying to build classification/regression models for the given csv. All notebooks can be found under the folder /notebooks. I started by doing some feature engineering in the notebooks/feature_engineering.ipynb, after that, i tried to build a XGBoost model to classify chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease, howver, as the result was really bad i analyze the data using anova (comparing a discreve variable like chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease that has 5 options with continous, binary and other variables.) and noticed that basically none of the attributes had statistical relevance to predict chronic_obstructive_pulmonary_disease, hence, i opted not to build a classifier and moved on to build a regression model for alanine_aminotransferases . on the folder notebooks/regression i explain more about the process, however, i found out only one varialbe that is BMI had a significant effect under the alanine_aminotransferases, then with a XGBRegressor i was able to get good results. With the saved model we can expose the XGBRegressor for an LLM agent when an user makes a question about a alanine_aminotransferases  prediction.
